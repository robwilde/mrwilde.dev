## Hello, I'm Robert Wilde 👋

I have worked with Technology for 30+ years, from Electronic Engineering, Sound and Lighting, Radio, PC Hardware, and
now Software Development.
I love fixing things and working with legacy code; to me, it's like restoring an old car to its original condition.
Sometimes you have to scrap it and do enjoy working on greenfield bespoke projects. As long as it's
challenging, solving a complex problem, and I am always happy to learn something new.

## My Expertise

I built my first PHP application in 2005, and have worked through all the classic frameworks since. I spent a long time
with WordPress, played with CakePHP and CodeIgnitor but then discovered Laravel. I have worked on a few Symfony
applications, and I do really like Symfony, but Laravel is GOAT when it comes to building things fast. I have also
worked with some other languages such as C++, Java, and Python. I am know building a few projects with Go and loving it.

## My Approach

I believe in the power of continuous learning and strive to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in the
field of software development. I am a strong advocate for clean and efficient code, and I always aim to deliver
high-quality solutions that exceed expectations.

## My Projects

Over the years, I have worked on a variety of projects ranging from small-scale applications to large enterprise
solutions. One of my most notable projects includes developing a real-time chat application using Socket.io, which
businesses have
widely used to improve communication among team members.

## My Goals

In the future, I'll aspire to further expand my knowledge and expertise in software development by exploring new
technologies and taking on challenging projects. I am committed to continuous improvement and look forward to
contributing to the ever-evolving field of technology.

## Let's Connect

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Whether you're looking to hire a developer or simply want to
chat about technology, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to connecting with you!
