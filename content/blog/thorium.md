description: The answer to cheap and clean power, is Thorium and Australia has one of the largest supplies of it on the planet

My Favourite videos on YouTube now are everything from [@kirksorensen](https://twitter.com/kirksorensen),
by [@gordonmcdowell](https://twitter.com/gordonmcdowell), talking about Thorium and Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor.

[Watch the LFTR explanation on YouTube](https://youtu.be/YVSmf_qmkbg)

Right at the start, Kirk outlines an estimated $1000,000,000 return from 1 Tonne of Thorium.

This doc I found from 2007, outlines not only is Australia the largest deposit of Thorium on the planet, but we also
have 489,000 Tonnes.

So you don't hurt yourself, as it was hurting my head getting around that number, let me show what that is in
dollars. $489 000, 000, 000, 000 or $489 TRILLION.
Even if you dumped a billion into an investment or five billion, how could you not get a return.

_NOTE: this number has been updated since 2007, and the numbers are somewhat larger now at 1,265 kt (1265,000 tonnes),
more than double._

I am no financial guru or anything like that, but seriously, what am I missing? How is this not the next big boom for
this country? Imagine a publicly owned company producing clean power from an abundant source, mined locally, that could
also produce FUEL. There is a process that has been tested and proven that can create aviation fuel that is more
efficient and cleaner than oil-based petroleum. So basically, Petrol from Seawater is better and cleaner than from oil
PLUS it will remove Co2 from the atmosphere. Watch below; it will blow your mind.

Thorium is the new GOLD and nearly every other precious metal all rolled into one, and it is everywhere. Not only
generate power efficiently, with ZERO emissions, but it has

- a short-life waste (around 300 years opposed to the current 10, 000 years)
- desalinate water
- produce very rare fuel for deep space missions
- create unique isotopes which help fight cancer
- assist in the production of aviation fuel from seawater

OMG-WTF It's like aliens have landed, given us the answers to most of the major world problems, and we just shrug and
say cool, then go about the day. My drive in life now is to generate enough recurring revenge in business, so I can spend
more time learning about this technology and maybe even studying Nuclear Engineering. If you want something done,
sometimes you have to do it yourself. I want my son living in a world powered by #LFTR #Thorium

Please comment, what do you think. If you disagree with anything here, tell me. We need to discuss this and talk about
this as much as possible. It is not a new technology it was discovered over 50 Years ago and forgotten. The more we talk
about it, the more people know and the closer we are to the world running on #Thorium #LFTR
