## Alf alias manager
=== Alf - Your Little Bash Alias Friend

- Create aliases by using a config file.
- Create aliases for sub-commands (for example, g s for git status).
- Synchronize your aliases across hosts or users by uploading your config file to GitHub.
- Does not alter anything in your system except for creating the ~/.bash_aliases file, which is normally already sourced by your login process.
Works with bash and zsh.
