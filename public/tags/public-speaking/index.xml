      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is all done, finished, over and kaput. WordCampSC has come and gone and what a fantastic weekend.&#xA;If I were only there as an attendee, I would still have learnt so much and been glad to have gone, but I was speaking for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did it go as planned? HELL NO! Part of the live demo material did not play out as rehearsed, several hours a day leading up to the event,&#xA;and every time I looked into the crowd all I could see were the faces of, what appeared to be, very confused people.&#xA;So why am I so happy? It is never, ever as bad as you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
