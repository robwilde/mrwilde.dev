      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-is-wp-cli&#34;&gt;So what is WP-CLI?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WP-CLI or the WordPress Command Line Interface is a PHP based tool that allows you to manage your WordPress site via SSH (Secure Shell) interface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In simpler terms, it is the back-door to your website. WP-Admin is the GUI or Graphical User interface gives you something nice to look at, with buttons and colours that can be accessed via a web page. WP-CLI drops the GUI and works with simple commands, providing more control and speed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is all done, finished, over and kaput. WordCampSC has come and gone and what a fantastic weekend.&#xA;If I were only there as an attendee, I would still have learnt so much and been glad to have gone, but I was speaking for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did it go as planned? HELL NO! Part of the live demo material did not play out as rehearsed, several hours a day leading up to the event,&#xA;and every time I looked into the crowd all I could see were the faces of, what appeared to be, very confused people.&#xA;So why am I so happy? It is never, ever as bad as you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
